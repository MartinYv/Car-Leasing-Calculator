CAR LEASING CALCULATOR

IVERVIEW
The Car Leasing Calculator is a web application designed to help users easily calculate the costs associated with leasing a car. The application takes into account various factors such as car type, car value, lease period, and down payment percentage to provide detailed leasing information including total leasing cost, down payment amount, monthly installment, and interest rate.


USAGE
*Select Car Type: Choose between "Brand New" or "Used" from the dropdown menu.
*Enter Car Value: Use the text input or the slider to specify the car value(10,000€ to 200,000€).
*Set Lease Period: Choose the lease period from the dropdown menu(12, 24, 36, 48, or 60 months).
*Set Down Payment: Use the text input or the slider to set the down payment percentage(range within 10% to 50%).
*View Leasing Details: The application will automatically update and display the total leasing cost, down payment amount, monthly installment, and interest rate.


HOW IT WORKS
Interest Rate Calculation: The interest rate is set based on the car type. Brand new cars have an interest rate of 2.99%, while used cars have an interest rate of 3.7%.

Down Payment Calculation: The down payment amount is calculated as a percentage of the car value.

Monthly Payment Calculation: The monthly installment is calculated using the formula for an installment loan, considering the principal amount, annual interest rate, and lease period.

Total Leasing Cost Calculation: The total leasing cost is derived from the monthly payments over the lease period, adjusted for the down payment and interest rate.
